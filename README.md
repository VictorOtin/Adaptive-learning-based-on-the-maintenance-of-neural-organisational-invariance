# Adaptive learning based on the maintenance of neural organisational invariance

## Abstract
An article in the journal Scientific Reports [1] proposes a learning mechanism that generates adaptive behaviour in simple environments by searching for the critical points, which are the phase transitions discussed above.

The first part of the work consists of bringing the algorithm's operation closer to that of real biological systems. This is achieved by replacing the finite neural network of the algorithm with an infinite network. In the second part, the algorithm is replicated with the new architecture and its results are tested not only in the same environments, but also in a more complex one. These environments are: A robot, a pendulum with an articulated bar and a snake learning to move forward.

In all environments it is observed that, simply by looking for these critical points, the agents generate interesting behaviours without having been programmed to do so. Moreover, the complexity of their behaviour increases as the size of the neural networks increases.

## Code
In this project, different parts of the code used for the master's thesis have been uploaded. The following environments have been analysed: Mountain Car, Acrobot and Swimmer.
